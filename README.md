# Student Churn Predictor (frontend prototype)

React + TypeScript + Vite single‑page app that lets you

1. Upload a CSV dataset containing numeric features and a `dropout` binary column.
2. Train a small neural network (tfjs) in the browser and persist it to IndexedDB.
3. Enter a new student's features and get an on‑device probability plus a simple explanation (feature values).

**Prototype only** – no backend needed, runs locally.
